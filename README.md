# Parallax Website
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Parallax Website! This site is a stunning demonstration of the parallax scrolling effect, achieved purely with HTML and CSS. The effect creates a dynamic and interactive user experience, making background images move slower than foreground images, thereby giving a sense of depth on the web page.

Features:-
- Pure HTML and CSS: No JavaScript or external libraries required.
- Responsive Design: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensures consistent look and behavior across major browsers.
